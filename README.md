- Splitting apps into components
- Property and Event binding / Input and output / EventEmitter
- Assigning Alias
- Encapsulation
- Local references
- ViewChild()
- ng-content: Projecting content
- Component lifecycle/ Lifecycle Hooks: ngOnInit/ngOnChanges/ngOnCheck/ngOnDestroy
- ContentChild() and more ..
